  of price shall be considered by MediWound at CBC's written request without the limit of no more often than once every [***] months.   4.2.3 MediWound shall make payment for each Bromelain SP batch that was supplied by CBC on a [***] days basis as of the date of delivery of the applicable batch at MediWound, provided that MediWound has provided CBC with an Acceptance Batch Notice for such purchased batch pursuant to Section 6.4. Payment for each purchase batch shall be effected by MediWound by swift to a bank account designated by CBC, or by other requested method as agreed between the parties. MediWound shall make down payment of USD[***]/kg for the [***]% of the amount of Annual Forecast before Dec.31 of the respective year for the insurance of components and materials and maintenance of manufacture and supply capacity of the requested [***]% of the next calendar year's Annual Forecast.

  4.2.6 The consideration to be paid pursuant to this Agreement is final and inclusive of all taxes and/or duties, of whatsoever nature. If applicable laws require the withholding of taxes, MediWound will deduct the taxes from the related payment otherwise due to CBC, and such taxes shall be paid to the proper taxing authority. For avoidance of doubt, payments will be made only after receiving exemption from tax deduction approval from the tax authority in Israel.

CBC shall inform MediWound of any announced regulatory inspections that directly involve the Bromelain SP or the Product within 48 hours of the notification to CBC of such an inspection.   5.5 During the term of this Agreement, CBC shall make available to MediWound any and all information and data which it generates or which comes into its possession relating to any improvements in the manufacture and supply of the Bromelain SP. CBC shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, assist MediWound in all respects with regard to regulatory submission including but not limited to providing any information, data or documents in its possession. If any regulatory agency requests any changes to the Specifications or the manufacturing process, (including but not limited to any changes as a result of an audit performed) CBC shall (i) inform MediWound in advance and in writing of the changes needed to be made, and (ii) promptly advise MediWound as to any lead-time changes or other terms which may result therefrom, and (iii) make such changes, in coordination with MediWound as soon as possible.
