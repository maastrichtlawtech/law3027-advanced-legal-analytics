All Compensation Shares will be fully vested upon issuance, and for a period of six (6) months following the date hereof, Lender may not sell in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Compensation Shares without the prior consent of MusclePharm; provided, that, the Lender shall be entitled, without the prior consent of MusclePharm, to transfer the Compensation Shares at any time to affiliates and family members so long as such transfers are in compliance with state and federal securities laws and such transferees agree to be bound by foregoing transfer restrictions for the six (6) month period following the date hereof with respect to the Compensation Shares. MusclePharm agrees that (i) with respect to the Compensation Shares, Lender shall be entitled to all rights and benefits under the registration rights agreement, dated as of March 28, 2013 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), by and among MusclePharm and the investors party thereto as if it were an investor party thereto, mutatis mutandis.

  (b) MusclePharm and Lender agree that, for purposes of determining the taxable income of Lender and the tax expense, deduction or other corresponding charge of MusclePharm, in each case in connection with the issuance of the Compensation Shares in accordance with this Section 8, the fair market value of the Compensation Shares shall be the amount set forth in any third-party valuation report delivered by Lender to MusclePharm within forty-five (45) days following the Issuance Date. MusclePharm will promptly provide all information reasonably requested by Lender and/or its valuation firm in connection with the preparation and delivery of such report. MusclePharm shall not take any position for tax purposes inconsistent with such fair market value as so determined without the consent of Lender; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude MusclePharm from utilizing a different method of calculating the fair market value of the Compensation Shares for financial accounting purposes if MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer, audit committee and independent auditors shall determine in good faith that such alternative calculation of the fair market value of the Compensation Shares is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.   (c) In connection with the issuance of the Compensation Shares, but without limitation of Section 8(a) or the other terms and conditions in this Agreement, Lender hereby makes the following representations to MusclePharm regarding the Compensation Shares:   (i) Lender understands that, as of the date hereof, none of the Compensation Shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, the availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Lender's representations as expressed herein. Lender is acquiring all of the Compensation Shares for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.   (ii) Lender understands that all of the Compensation Shares will constitute "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws, inasmuch as it is being acquired from MusclePharm or such other company in one or more transactions not involving a public offering and that under such laws the Compensation Shares may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. The certificates representing the Compensation Shares will be endorsed with a legend to such effect. Lender has been informed and understands that (i) there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Compensation Shares, and (ii) no federal or state agency has made any finding or determination as to the fairness for public investment, nor any recommendation nor endorsement, of the Compensation Shares.   (iii)  Lender, or Lender's business and financial advisors, have substantial experience in evaluating and investing in private transactions of securities in companies similar to MusclePharm and such other company and Lender acknowledges that it can protect its own interests. Lender, or such advisors, have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its acceptance of all of the Compensation Shares of MusclePharm as compensation or otherwise.

  (iv) Lender is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.   (v) Lender understands that all books, records, and documents of MusclePharm relating to it have been and remain available for inspection by him or his business and financial advisors upon reasonable notice. Lender confirms that all documents requested have been made available, and that it or such advisors have been supplied with all of the information concerning MusclePharm that has been requested. Lender confirms that it or such advisors have obtained sufficient information, in its and their judgment to evaluate the merits and risks of receipt of the Compensation Shares as compensation or otherwise. Lender confirms that it has had the opportunity to obtain such independent legal and tax advice and financial planning services as it has deemed appropriate prior to making a decision to enter this Agreement. In making each such decision, Lender has relied exclusively upon its experience and judgment, or that of such advisors, upon such independent investigations as it, or they, deemed appropriate, and upon information provided by MusclePharm in writing or found in the books, records, or documents of MusclePharm.   (vi) Lender is aware that the economic ownership of the Compensation Shares is highly speculative and subject to substantial risks. Lender is capable of bearing the high degree of economic risk and burdens of this venture, including, but not limited to, the possibility of a complete loss, the lack of a sustained and orderly public market, and limited transferability of the Compensation Shares, which may make the liquidation thereof impossible for the indefinite future.   (vii) The offer to issue the Compensation Shares as compensation to Lender was directly communicated to Lender or its business or financial advisors by such a manner that it or such advisors were able to ask questions of and receive answers from MusclePharm or a person acting on its behalf concerning this Agreement. At no time was Lender presented with or solicited by or through any leaflet, public promotional meeting, television advertisement, or any other form of general advertising.   (viii)  None of the following information has ever been represented, guaranteed, or warranted to Lender, expressly or by implication by any broker, MusclePharm, or agent or employee of the foregoing, or by any other person:   (1) The approximate or exact length of time that Lender will be required to remain as a holder of any of the Compensation Shares;   (2) The amount of consideration, profit, or loss to be realized, if any, as a result of owning any of the Compensation Shares; or   (3)  That the past performance or experience of MusclePharm, its officers, directors, associates, agents, affiliates, or employees or any other person will in any way indicate or predict economic results in connection with the plan of operations of MusclePharm or the return on any of the Compensation Shares.
